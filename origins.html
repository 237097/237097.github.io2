          <h3>How did origami get its name?</h3>
          <p>
            Origami comes from the Japanese words for fold and paper. The term
            origami today refers to the craft or the artform of paper folding.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the purpose of making origami?</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of making origami was originally for the decoration of
            temples and shrines. Today, it is considered a craft or an art. It
            can also be used to learn more about geometry.
          </p>
          <h3>When was origami first invented?</h3>
          <p>
            Origami was invented in China shortly after the development of paper
            in the 2nd century. Monks brought paper, as well as the idea of
            folding it, to Japan in the 6th century.

              The Japanese word origami itself is a compound of two smaller
              Japanese words: "ori", meaning to fold, and "kami", meaning paper.
              Until recently, not all forms of paper folding were grouped under
              the word origami. Before that, paper folding for play was known by
              a variety of names, including "orikata" or "origata", "orisue",
              "orimono", "tatamigami" and others.

            <p class="article_text">
              By the 7th century, paper had been introduced to Japan from China
              via the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese developed washi by
              improving the method of making paper in the Heian period. The
              paper making technique developed in Japan around 805 to 809 was
              called nagashi-suki, a method of adding mucilage to the process of
              the conventional technique to form a stronger layer of paper
              fibers. With the development of Japanese paper making technology
              and the widespread use of paper, folded paper began to be used for
              decorations and tools for religious ceremonies such as gohei,
              ōnusa and shide at Shinto shrines. Religious decorations made of
              paper and the way gifts were wrapped in folded paper gradually
              became stylized and established as ceremonial origami. During the
              Heian period, the Imperial court established a code of etiquette
              for wrapping money and goods used in ceremonies with folded paper,
              and a code of etiquette for wrapping gifts.
              <br />
              In the Muromachi period from the 1300s to the 1400s, various forms
              of decorum were developed by the Ogasawara clan and Ise clans,
              completing the prototype of Japanese folded-paper decorum that
              continues to this day. The Ise clan presided over the decorum of
              the inside of the palace of the Ashikaga Shogunate, and in
              particular, Ise Sadachika during the reign of the eighth Shogun,
              Ashikaga Yoshimasa , greatly influenced the development of the
              decorum of the daimyo and samurai classes, leading to the
              development of various stylized forms of ceremonial origami. The
              shapes of ceremonial origami created in this period were
              geometric, and the shapes of noshi to be attached to gifts at
              feasts and weddings, and origami that imitated butterflies to be
              displayed on sake vessels, were quite different from those of
              later generations of recreational origami whose shapes captured
              the characteristics of real objects and living things. The "noshi"
              wrapping, and the folding of female and male butterflies, which
              are still used for weddings and celebrations, are a continuation
              and development of a tradition that began in the Muromachi period.

              When Japan opened its borders in the 1860s, as part of a
              modernization strategy, they imported Fröbel's Kindergarten
              system-and with it, German ideas about paperfolding. This included
              the ban on cuts, and the starting shape of a bicolored square.
              These ideas, and some of the European folding repertoire, were
              integrated into the Japanese tradition. Before this, traditional
              Japanese sources use a variety of starting shapes, often had cuts,
              and if they had color or markings, these were added after the
              model was folded. In Japan, the first kindergarten was established
              in 1875, and origami was promoted as part of early childhood
              education. The kindergarten's 1877 regulations listed 25
              activities, including origami subjects. Shōkokumin, a magazine for
              boys, frequently published articles on origami. Origami Zusetsu,
              published in 1908, clearly distinguished ceremonial origami from
              recreational origami. These books and magazines carried both the
              traditional Japanese style of origami and the style inspired by
              Fröbel.
              <br />
              In the early 1900s, Akira Yoshizawa, Kosho Uchiyama, and others
              began creating and recording original origami works. Akira
              Yoshizawa in particular was responsible for a number of
              innovations, such as wet-folding and the Yoshizawa-Randlett
              diagramming system. During the 1980s a number of folders started
              systematically studying the mathematical properties of folded
              forms, which led to a rapid increase in the complexity of origami
              models.
              <br />
              Starting in the late 20th century, there has been a renewed
              interest in understanding the behavior of folding matter, both
              artistically and scientifically. The "new origami," which
              distinguishes it from old craft practices, has had a rapid
              evolution due to the contribution of computational mathematics and
              the development of techniques such as box-pleating, tessellations
              and wet-folding. Artists like Robert J. Lang, Erik Demaine, Sipho
              Mabona, Giang Dinh, Paul Jackson, and others, are frequently cited
              for advancing new applications of the art. The computational facet
              and the interchanges through social networks, where new techniques
              and designs are introduced, have raised the profile of origami in
              the 21st century.
