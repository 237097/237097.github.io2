            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
          </div>
          <h3>Does thickness of your paper matter?</h3>
          <p>
            Paper thickness often refered to as GSM (grammes per square meter)
            is crucial and often varies a lot beetween projects. Thicker papper
            is much stronger, but it is difficult to crease multiple times. On
            the other side, thinner paper can be folded into many layers without
            being bulky, but it is more fragile and prone to tears.
          </p>
          <h3>Does my paper have to be a perfect square?</h3>
          <p>
            Not at all! Origami projects often use other geometrical shapes like
            rectangle, circle or even pentagon which for example is used in
            making of a very beautifull yet difficult Rose designed by Naomiki
            Sato.
          </p>
          <h3>What is the best paper for beginners?</h3>
          <p>
            Standard (or Kami in Japanese) origami paper is the best paper for
            learning origami. It is strong and durable and perfect for getting
            started!

              The best paper for origami is called "Kami" (the Japanese word for
              origami paper), the standard origami paper. Kami comes from Japan
              in factories that have been around for generations and have staff
              that have honed their skills over many years. They start with
              white base paper and ink or stamp various colors and designs onto
              it depending on the type of origami paper being created.

              The meaning of the term Tant is "a lot," which means an abundance
              of color. Tant paper has become famous in the Japanese origami
              world because it is a dyed fiber paper that does not break even
              after repeated creases and can keep beautiful surface texture.
              Tant paper is made by Hokuetsu Paper Mill Company and is only made
              in Japan.

              Washi is a traditional Japanese paper that's made using long plant
              fibers. This paper has a very unique Japanese feel, and was
              originated by Japanese masters that have passed the skill on for
              generations. It is usually very thin and is often fabric-like to
              the touch.

              This paper has a color tissue paper to one or both sides of a
              sheet of aluminum foil sheet. Tissue foil is one of the easiest
              papers to use for origami, because it is a combination of foil and
              tissue paper. In the past the only way to get this paper was to
              make it yourself, which can be costly and time consuming.
